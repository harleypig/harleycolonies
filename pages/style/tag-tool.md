## Tag Tool Usage

The Tag Tool is essential for advanced schematic features:

**Essential Tags:**
- `groundlevel`: Set on supply camps/ships and buildings not sitting directly on ground
- `invisible`: Hide child-only buildings or decorations from build menu
- `work`: Mark work positions for various huts (archery standing positions, etc.)

**Job-Specific Tags:**
- Guard towers can be limited with `job=knight`, `job=ranger`, or `job=druid`
- Mines can be limited with `job=miner` or `job=quarrier`

**Plantation Field Tags:**
- Field tags: `sugar_field`, `cactus_field`, `bamboo_field`, `cocoa_field`, etc.
- Work tags: `sugar`, `cactus`, `bamboo`, `cocoa`, etc.
- Each field can have multiple field tags but not duplicates
- Work tag limits vary by plant type (see plantation requirements)

**Mine Tags:**
- `ladder`: Mark starting ladder positions
- `cobble`: Mark blocks where mineshaft will begin
