## Style

I want to create my own style for [Minecolonies](https://minecolonies.com). So
we need to start with a list of huts. This list is based off of the
[tutorial](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/tutorials/schematics) for creating
schematics.

A list of buildings is available on the wiki. Click on the `Buildings` menu item.

## Why?

I'm a minimalist. I want to standardize the hut layouts as much as possible,
to make creation of the various groupings as easy as possible.

I want to put huts underground that conceptually makes sense. Some groupings
will be all aboveground, or at least on the same level, some might be all
underground, some might be a mix.

For example:

- the farm/composter group would be on the same level, though it's possible
    fields might be scattered about
- the combat academy, archery, and barracks might be all underground
- one of the materials groups might be mixed (e.g., blacksmith above ground
    and the others below)

### Notes

- **Residence/Guardtower pairing**: These appear together throughout the
    document because they should be designed as paired buildings with
    [parent/child](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/tutorials/schematics#how-to-create-parentchild-buildings-or-decorations)
    relationships to enable auto-leveling.

- **Research and requirement notation**: `hutname (research branch level; building requirement)`
  - Example: `sawmill (technology 1; forester 3)` means the sawmill requires
      technology research level 1 AND a forester hut at level 3
  - If no research is needed (like forester), only the hut name is shown
  - See [research system](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/systems/research) for
      details
  - Physical requirements ('field blocks' for farmer, etc.) are listed as
      sub-bullets starting with 'requires ...'. See [hut
      requirements](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/tutorials/schematics#hut-requirements)
