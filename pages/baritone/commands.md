## Using Commands

### Command Prefix

Baritone commands use the `#` prefix by default. For example:
- `#goal 100 64 200` - Set a goal
- `#mine diamond_ore` - Mine diamonds
- `#help` - Show help

You can also use commands without the prefix if `chatControl` is enabled (default: `true`).

### Command Aliases

Many commands have multiple names (aliases). For example:
- `cancel`, `c`, `stop` all refer to the same command
- `waypoints`, `waypoint`, `wp` all refer to the same command

All aliases are shown together in the documentation.

### Tab Completion

Baritone supports tab completion for commands and their arguments. Press `Tab` while typing a command to see available completions.

### Getting Help

Use the `#help` command to see all available commands, or `#help <command>` to see detailed help for a specific command.
