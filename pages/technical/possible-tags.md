# Suggested Behavior-Oriented Tags

## Mechanics / Rules

- mechanic-tweak — generic rules changes that don’t fit CF’s buckets.
- interaction-tweak — changes to how blocks/entities respond to player input.
- rightclick-behavior — specifically modifies right-click actions.
- player-action-modifier — alters how vanilla actions behave (eat, jump, sneak, use).
- block-behavior-modifier — modifies block rules without adding new blocks.
- world-rules-adjustment — light rule changes that affect gameplay logic.
- vanilla-balance-adjustment — buffs/nerfs to default mechanics.

Systems / Automation (not CF “tech”)

- micro-automation — tiny automations (auto-harvest, auto-pickup, etc.).
- passive-automation — things that automate by altering rules, not via machines.
- implicit-automation — automation achieved through modified behaviors, not added blocks/items.

User Experience / Interaction

- intuitive-interactions — makes interactions do what players “expect.”
- reduced-friction — cuts annoyances without being full QoL (subtle, behavior-based).
- zero-block-additions — no new blocks/items; pure logic changes.
- vanilla-friendly — fits into vanilla feel without adding content.

Gameplay Style Impact

- progression-light — changes early/mid progression without overhaul.
- pace-adjustment — speeds/slows common gameplay loops.
- grind-reduction — reduces repetitive tasks indirectly.
- survival-comfort — improves survival play specifically via mechanics.

World Interaction

- farm-interaction — affects farmland, crops, bonemeal behavior, etc.
- environment-interaction — mod alters player ↔ environment interactions broadly.
- resource-flow-adjustment — changes how resources are acquired, consumed.

Technical / Behavior Logic

- vanilla-logic-hook — attaches custom logic into vanilla events.
- lightweight-no-coremod — explicitly non-invasive implementation.
- minimal-invasive — changes behavior without altering data packs or registries.

Modder-Oriented Tags (if you index code-level patterns)

- event-driven — built on event callbacks.
- behavior-patch — patches existing logic rather than replacing it.
- functional-minimalist — very small code footprint, targeted purpose.
