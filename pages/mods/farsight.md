title: Farsight [Forge/Neo]

Client/Server: both

**Farsight** increases the maximum render distance beyond Minecraft's
vanilla limits, allowing players to see much farther into the distance.
This mod is particularly useful for players with powerful hardware who want
to take advantage of increased view distances for better visibility and
immersion. The mod provides configurable maximum render distance limits to
prevent excessive performance impact.

### Configuration

Below are the available options and their defaults. Paths and values use
the same names as in the mod's config file, `farsight.json`.

#### Render Distance Settings

- `maxRenderDistance` (default: `64`)
  - Maximum allowed render distance in chunks. This sets the upper limit
    for how far players can see, beyond vanilla Minecraft's default
    maximum. Higher values provide better visibility but significantly
    impact performance. The default of 64 chunks is already very high
    compared to vanilla's maximum of 32 chunks.
