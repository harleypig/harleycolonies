Client/Server: both

**JourneyMap** is a full-featured mapping mod for Minecraft that provides
real-time mapping, waypoint management, and exploration tools. The mod
creates detailed maps of explored areas, allows players to set waypoints,
and provides both minimap and fullscreen map views. JourneyMap includes
server administration features for managing map data and player access.

### Configuration

Below are the available options and their defaults. Paths and values use
the same names as in the mod's config file, `journeymap-server.toml`.

#### Admin Settings

- `admins.opAccess` (default: `true`)
  - Default, all Ops have access to Server Admin UI in the Options screen.
    If set to `false`, only users in the Admin List will have access. If
    set to `true`, all ops and users in the Admin List will have access.

- `admins.serverAdmins` (default: `["mysticdrew",
  "79f597fe-2877-4ecb-acdf-8c58cc1854ca"]`)
  - Players in this list have access to the JourneyMap's Server Admin
    Panel. Add users by name or UUID, prefer UUID as it is more secure!
    Each value on a new line with the example format provided. (Please
    delete the default values)
