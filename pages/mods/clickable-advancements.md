title: Clickable advancements[Forge/Fabric]
---



Client/Server: both

**Clickable advancements** enhances the Minecraft advancement system by
making advancement notifications in chat clickable. When players earn
advancements, they can click on the advancement message in chat to
instantly open the advancement screen and view details about that
advancement. This feature is particularly useful in modpacks with
numerous mods, as it helps players easily navigate and understand their
progression without manually searching through the advancement tree.

### Configuration

Below are the available options and their defaults. Paths and values use
the same names as in the mod's config file, `clickadv.json`.

#### Chat Display Settings

- `showAllInLocalChat.showAllInLocalChat` (default: `true`)
  - By default, vanilla Minecraft only displays advancements in chat
    which get broadcasted to all online players. Enabling this setting
    allows non-broadcasted advancements to show up in your personal chat
    (other players don't see it). Some of these may be lacking text when
    the advancement itself does not have any, for example, categories are
    advancements too. When enabled, you'll see more advancement
    notifications in your chat, making it easier to track your progress
    even for advancements that aren't server-wide broadcasts.
