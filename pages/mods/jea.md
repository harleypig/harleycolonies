Client/Server: both

**Just Enough Advancements (JEA)** integrates advancement information
into JEI (Just Enough Items), allowing players to view advancement
requirements and progress directly within the JEI interface. The mod
displays which items, blocks, or actions are needed to complete
advancements, making progression tracking easier and more integrated with
the crafting interface.

### Configuration

Below are the available options and their defaults. Paths and values use
the same names as in the mod's config file, `jea.json5`.

#### Display Settings

- `hiddenAdvancements` (default: `true`)
  - When this option is disabled, hidden advancements will not display on
    the client. This is a server-side option and the value set on the
    server will override the value set on the client. When enabled, hidden
    advancements (those that don't show in the advancement screen) are still
    visible in JEI.
