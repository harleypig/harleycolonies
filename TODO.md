# TODO

## Blueprints & Schematics

- Make blueprints of farms
- Can baritone read/build from minecolonies blueprints?
- Do sites like planetminecraft have farm blueprints? Or worlds with farms I can make blueprints from?
- Maybe make blueprints have road builtin?
- Can I make groupings a parent/child?
- Look into using auto-leveling for some blueprints
- ??? Make residence the parent, guardtower, cookery, and bakery child with auto-leveling?
- Some hut blocks may require material not available when the main blueprint is laid down. Those will need to be either created at later levels for the blueprint, or a marker left at the spot and depend on the player to place the hut block correctly.
- Maybe have multiple farms in the main blueprint, one field for each farm. Create separate blueprints for extra fields.
- Some farm field blueprints with both above and below ground fields?
- Same for plantations ... have multiple plantation huts, one field for each and create separate blueprints for extra plantation fields. (see [this section](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/tutorials/schematics#plantation-fields) of the schematics link, as well as the following related sections.)
- Fisher hut should have both a water/pool integrated and a version that can be used with an existing body of water.
- For the mine, do the required blocks need to be cobblestone if they're tagged 'cobble'?
- Custom mineshafts? Is that only the vertical, initial shaft, or the horizontal shafts, or both?

## Farms & Resources

- Figure out a way to use the same farm to do all of them (multiple uses - cactus, bamboo, sugarcane can be used to make bonemeal; bamboo and kelp can be used as a fuel source)

## Minecolonies - Buildings & Huts

- I don't like the quarry, I won't be using it. I'll have to see if it can be incorporated to my satisfaction. Can the opening for the quarry be underground?
- NOTE: A barrackstower doesn't need to be a tower. It could be quonset hut.
- ???: Will putting all animals in the same pen cause confusion for the worker?
- Can multiple meat farmer's use a single field?
- Can a plantation field have multiple items growing from it, even if the worker isn't harvesting them?

## Mods & Configuration

- Locations of the configuration files for the mods will be added later.

## Technical / Code
