# HarleyColonies

I grind all day at work, why would I want to play a game that requires me to
grind to get anywhere?!

This modpack is an attempt to reduce grinding as much as possible.

Minecolonies is central to this idea, so any mod that cause a conflict and
that cannot be resolved will not be included in this pack.

I'm also using Baritone AI pathfinder. If you have a problem with that, you can
always disable it.

NOTE:

I'm using the [`packwiz`](https://packwiz.infra.link) app to create this
modpack. If there are any eccentricities in my documentation or configuration,
feel free to let me know.
