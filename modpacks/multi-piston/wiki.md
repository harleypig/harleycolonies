**Multi-Piston** extends the functionality of pistons by allowing them to
push multiple blocks at once. The mod enables more complex redstone
contraptions and building mechanisms by removing the vanilla piston limit
of 12 blocks.

### Features

- **Extended Push Range**: Pistons can push more than the vanilla limit of
  12 blocks.
- **Redstone Compatible**: Works with all standard redstone contraptions.
- **Building Aid**: Useful for moving large structures and complex builds.
