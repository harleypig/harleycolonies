  - name: allowDiagonalDescend

    description: |
      Allow descending diagonally

      Safer than allowParkour yet still slightly unsafe, can make contact with
      unchecked adjacent blocks, so it's unsafe in the nether.

      For a generic "take some risks" mode I'd turn on this one, parkour, and
      parkour place.

      But it's very unreliable and falls off when cornering like all the time

      It also overshoots the landing pretty much always (making contact with
      the next block over), so be careful

      click, which means it'll open the chest instead of placing against it.
      That's why this defaults to off.
