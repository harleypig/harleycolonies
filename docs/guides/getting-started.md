# Getting Started

This guide provides a beginner-friendly build order for using this custom
Minecolonies style. These huts and workers should be created once the initial
steps outlined in `Colony Rules` has been completed.

For detailed building requirements, schematic configurations, and technical
specifications, see [Building Hut Requirements](huts.md).

The exact order depends on your needs, but all of these should be completed
before moving on to more advanced hut and worker creation.

Keep in mind that housing is going to be needed to provide both new workers
and space for them.

## First things first.

Create at least one additonal builder and house. Best practice is to spread
them out so that building huts goes faster.

Then update them to as high a level as possible, otherwise they'll take
forever to build. Generally, level 3 is relatively quick and easy.

## Update and create huts

After establishing your initial colony infrastructure, you should focus on
building the following huts in this recommended order. This progression
optimizes your colony's efficiency and resource management.

The recommended build order is:

1. **Storage and Logistics** - First priority to ensure items can be stored and moved efficiently
2. **Food Production** - Essential for feeding your growing population
3. **Food Processing** - Turns raw ingredients into meals for your colonists
4. **Basic Resource Processing** - Provides tools and processed materials for further expansion

You should get all of these huts working at level 1 before upgrading any of
them to higher levels. This ensures you have all the basic functionality in
place before investing in improvements.

**Be sure to add Guard Towers at the appropriate intersections as they are
created.**

### 1. Storage and Logistics

These buildings should be your first priority as they form the backbone of
your colony's item management system:

* Warehouse - Central storage for all your colony's resources
* Courier's Hut
  - Courier - Moves items between buildings
* House for the courier

See [Storage](huts.md#storage) for detailed building requirements and
schematic configurations.

### 2. Food Production

Once your storage system is in place, focus on sustainable food sources:

* Farm
  - Farmer - Grows crops for food and other resources
* Fisher's Hut
  - Fisher - Provides fish as an additional food source
* Houses for these workers

See [Produce](huts.md#produce), [Meat](huts.md#meat), and
[Meat II](huts.md#meat-ii) for detailed building requirements and schematic
configurations.

### 3. Food Processing

With food sources established, build facilities to process raw ingredients
into meals:

* Cookery
  - Chef - Prepares complex meals
* Restaurant
  - Cook - Serves food to colonists
* Bakery (optional, can be built later)
  - Baker - Makes bread and pastries
* Houses for these workers

See [Feed the Masses](huts.md#feed-the-masses) for detailed building
requirements and schematic configurations.

### 4. Basic Resource Processing

Finally, establish your basic production chain for tools and materials:

* Blacksmith's Hut
  - Blacksmith - Creates tools and weapons
* Sawmill
  - Carpenter - Processes wood into advanced components
* Smeltery
  - Smelter - Processes ores into ingots
* Houses for these workers

See [Wood](huts.md#wood), [Stone](huts.md#stone), and
[Metal/Creative/Tinkerer](huts.md#metalcreativetinkerer) for detailed
building requirements and schematic configurations.

## Upgrading Strategy

### Priority Upgrades

Focus your first upgrades on buildings that provide the most immediate
benefits:

1. **Builder's Hut** - Priority upgrade to level 3-4 to speed up all future construction
2. **Warehouse** - Upgrade to level 3 to increase storage capacity
3. **Miner's Hut** - Upgrade to level 3 to access deeper resources
4. **Forester's Hut** - Upgrade to level 2-3 for better wood production
5. **Guard Towers** - Upgrade to level 2-3 for larger protection area

### Upgrade Timing

* Upgrade your Builder's Hut immediately after completing the basic
  infrastructure
* After establishing all basic huts at level 1, pause expansion when your
  colony reaches 15-20 citizens
* Focus on upgrading essential buildings to level 3 before continuing
  expansion
* Consider adding 1-2 additional Builders once you have 20+ citizens to handle
  upgrades and new construction simultaneously

### Resource Preparation

* Stockpile stone, wood, and iron before beginning major upgrade phases
* Create a dedicated storage area for upgrade materials
* Consider adding a second Miner and Forester before starting major upgrades
* Add a Quarrier if stone becomes a bottleneck
* Create a dedicated area for tree farming, or perhaps place trees in stragic
  locations around the forester's hut.

### Worker Expansion

As your colony grows beyond 25 citizens, consider adding:

* 3-4 Builders total (spread throughout your colony)
* 2 Miners (one for deep mining, one for surface resources)
* 2 Foresters (in different wooded areas)
* 1 Quarrier (if stone needs are high)

Balance your upgrades with new construction based on your colony's immediate
needs and resource availability.
