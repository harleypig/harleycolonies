# Building Hut Requirements

## Residence/Guard Tower

* 1 bed for guard Tower
* per level for residence:
  * 1 bed

**Possible Parent/Child Configuration:**
* Auto-leveling parent/child relationship
* Guard Tower bed is not functional, making auto-leveling viable
* Guard Tower will go much higher than Residence, so parent/child works
* Note: Residence beds ARE functional, but auto-leveling still works because
  guard tower bed is decorative

## Town Hall

* Standalone building (no parent/child relationships)

## Builder

  embedding)
* Residence/Guard Tower combo has functional beds (auto-level viable for
  that relationship)

  Residence/Guard Tower child, or separate placement

## Basic Layout

See the various sections in the
[Schematics](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/tutorials/schematics) page in the
Minecolonies Wiki.

* Each grouping above (wood, stone, etc.), with some exceptions, will be based
  on an upgradable decoration schematic.
  * Will have access points both above and below ground.
  * Will be surrounded by a road at both ground level and underground.

### Residence/Guard Tower Blueprints

* parent/child
* auto level?
* guard tower will go much higher than residence

**Ground Floor:**
```

## Notes

* Research Requirement in parens.

* 'per level' is usually a minimum.

* Combat grouping has no Residence or Guard Tower because of Barracks Towers.

### To be researched

* **Archery, Barracks Tower, and Combat Academy huts:**
  * Are practice dummies considered 'functional' for parent/child relationship?
  * Since beds are decorative, are they considered functional for parent/child
    relationship?
* **Graveyard hut and graves:**
  * Are graves considered 'functional' for parent/child relationship?

See [TODO.md](../../TODO.md) for questions and items to investigate.
