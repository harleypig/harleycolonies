Basic Layout

See the various sections in the
[Schematics](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/tutorials/schematics) page in the
Minecolonies Wiki.

* Each grouping above (wood, stone, etc.), with some exceptions, will be based
  on an upgradable decoration schematic.
  - Will have access points both above and below ground.
  - Will be surrounded by a road at both ground level and underground.

  Can I make groupings a parent/child?
  Look into using auto-leveling for some blueprints.

* Residence/Guard Tower Blueprints:
  - parent/child
  - auto level?
  - guard tower will go much higher than residence
  - Ground Floor:
    +------------+
    |           S|
    |           t|
    +---        a|
    |xx|        i|
    |  |        r|
    |dd|dd-------+
  - Second/Third Floor:
    +------------+
    |Bed        S|
    |Bed        t|
    +---        a|
    |xx|        i|
    |  |        r|
    |--|---------+
  - Basement Floor:
    +------------+
    |Bed        S|
    |           t|
    +---        a|
    |xx|        i|
    |  |        r|
    |--|---------+

Notes/Questions:

* Research Requirement in parens.

* 'per level' is usually a minimum.

* Combat grouping has no Residence or Guard Tower because of Barracks Towers.

* Some hut blocks may require material not available when the main blueprint
  is laid down. Those will need to be either created at later levels for the
  blueprint, or a marker left at the spot and depend on the player to place
  the hut block correctly.

* Can multiple meat farmer's use a single field?

* I don't like the quarry, at least the way it works in Minecolonies. I'll
  have to see if it can be incorporated to my satisfaction. Can the opening
  for the quary be underground?

* Maybe have multiple farms in the main blueprint, one field for each farm.
  Create separate blueprints for extra fields.

* Some farm field blueprints with both above and below ground fields?

* Same for plantations ... have multiple plantation huts, one field for each
  and create separate blueprints for extra plantation fields. (see [this
  section](https://minecolonies.com/wiki/tutorials/schematics#plantation-fields))
  of the schematics link, as well as the following related sections.

* Can a plantation field have multiple items growning from it, even if the
  worker isn't harvesting them?

* Fisher hut should have both a water/pool integrated and a version that can
  be used with an existing body of water.

* For the mine, do the required blocks need to be cobblestone if they're
  tagged 'cobble'?

* Custom mineshafts? Is that only the vertical,  initial shaft, or the
  horizontal shafts, or both?
