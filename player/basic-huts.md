# Basic Huts

These huts and workers should be created once the initial steps outlined in
`Colony Rules` has been completed.

The exact order depends on your needs, but all of these should be completed
before moving on to more advanced hut and worker creation.

Keep in mind that housing is going to be needed to provide both new workers
and space for them.

## First things first.

Create at least one additonal builder and house. Best practice is to spread
them out so that building huts goes faster.

Then update them to as high a level as possible, otherwise they'll take
forever to build. Generally, level 3 is relatively quick and easy.

## Update and create huts

After establishing your initial colony infrastructure, you should focus on
building the following huts in this recommended order. This progression
optimizes your colony's efficiency and resource management.

The recommended build order is:

1. **Storage and Logistics** - First priority to ensure items can be stored and moved efficiently
2. **Food Production** - Essential for feeding your growing population
3. **Food Processing** - Turns raw ingredients into meals for your colonists
4. **Basic Resource Processing** - Provides tools and processed materials for further expansion

You should get all of these huts working at level 1 before upgrading any of
them to higher levels. This ensures you have all the basic functionality in
place before investing in improvements.

### 1. Storage and Logistics

These buildings should be your first priority as they form the backbone of
your colony's item management system:

* Warehouse - Central storage for all your colony's resources
* Courier's Hut
  - Courier - Moves items between buildings
* House for the courier

### 2. Food Production

Once your storage system is in place, focus on sustainable food sources:

* Farm
  - Farmer - Grows crops for food and other resources
* Fisher's Hut
  - Fisher - Provides fish as an additional food source
* Houses for these workers

### 3. Food Processing

With food sources established, build facilities to process raw ingredients
into meals:

* Cookery
  - Chef - Prepares complex meals
* Restaurant
  - Cook - Serves food to colonists
* Bakery (optional, can be built later)
  - Baker - Makes bread and pastries
* Houses for these workers

### 4. Basic Resource Processing

Finally, establish your basic production chain for tools and materials:

* Blacksmith's Hut
  - Blacksmith - Creates tools and weapons
* Sawmill
  - Carpenter - Processes wood into advanced components
* Smeltery
  - Smelter - Processes ores into ingots
* Houses for these workers

## Updating ...

Any suggestions for how much time should be spent updating huts (and don't
forget the huts from the previous setup) before moving on to the next group of
huts to be created? Also, consider creating more builders, foresters and maybe
another miner or a quarrier, depending on your needs.
