# Basic Huts

These huts and workers should be created once the initial steps outlined in
`Colony Rules` has been completed.

The exact order depends on your needs, but all of these should be completed
before moving on to more advanced hut and worker creation.

Keep in mind that housing is going to be needed to provide both new workers
and space for them.

## First things first.

Create at least one additonal builder and house. Best practice is to spread
them out so that building huts goes faster.

Then update them to as high a level as possible, otherwise they'll take
forever to build. Generally, level 3 is relatively quick and easy.

## Update and create huts.

This depends on your needs and resources. You'll probably want to at least get
the courier going before any of the others.

You should probably get all of the following huts working at level 1 before
trying to update anything else.
